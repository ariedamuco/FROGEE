The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.\",\n",

       " \"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a\\xa0Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug\\xa0to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.\",\n",

       " \"This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.\",\n",

       " \"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.\",\n",
       " 'We just received the phone a few days ago. Put in the Consumer Cellular SIM card, and it is ready to go. The phone seems very nice even though we have not come close to discovering all of the things it will do. It has a large number of ring tones built in.',\n",
       " \"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!\",\n",

The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.\",\n",
       " \"This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.\",\n",

The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some.

       " 'Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the \"cheapest quad-core phone,\" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn\\'t a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn\\'t bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn\\'t have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0\" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It\\'s not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn\\'t be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I\\'ve noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do.',\n",

If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that\\'s problem is solved. No it wasn\\'t. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn\\'t see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn\\'t work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don\\'t have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven\\'t used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it.

Buttons light up bright, ringtone volume is adjustable and on max it's more than loud enough for anyone with a hearing problem; though surprisingly the call volume is not adjustable, though it is louder than the previous Verizon flip phone on max volume. I set this up with Cricket service. The phone takes a MINI SIM CARD. Not a micro as someone else has stated. I had to buy another sim card because the micro I ordered was too small. Mini sims are the original, large cards. We live in the US. I don't know people are claiming this phone doesn't work in the US. I paid 30ish for this phone, but would have paid up to 100 for it because of the design and functionality.

       " \"With a little bit of effort I was able to familiarize myself with this phone, and using it became intuitive. It came with a nice easy to read booklet, and before purchasing it I checked to see if it has a web, site which it does. I inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours. I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive. For $14.25 (with my AARP discount) I get 4 hours of talk per month.\",\n",

       " 'I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated \"senior\" phone stopped working. I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that\\'s what it says in Spanish. I set my mom\\'s phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn\\'t need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let\\'s face it, it\\'s the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can\\'t beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it\\'s not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great. The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to \"senior\" phones, it\\'s slim pickings. This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder.',\n",

I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of \"you get what you pay for\".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I\\'m going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do.

A second serious hardware problem is that the speaker runs extremely hot, and one cannot place it next to the ear. Must use earphones, or suffer burns.3. Battery life totally sucks.4. Touch screen is exceedingly sensitive, so it registers being touched even if you do not touch it.5. There appears to be nobody in the world that makes a protective case that fits this phone.

The security sticker was broken when I got my product, and when I contacted the seller they said that was okay as long as the phone worked. I still haven't been able to use data on the phone and can only use for calls and texts. Also, I'm afraid to out this phone up to my ear. When I did, it burned really hot and radiated heat. It is cheaply made. The touch screen is fickle and unresponsive. It has zero in phone storage, so no apps. Bottom line is that I wished I would have spent a little more money and bought a different phone.\",\n",

I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of \"you get what you pay for\".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I\\'m going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I\\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!!',\n",

Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you\\'re a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review.',\n",

The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it.

It is super easy to us,e and really sharp looking. I am not interested in paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars for ANY PHONE! This has all of the functions anyone could ever need. I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don\\'t really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are \"given the phones in exchange for a review\", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have.

And since this is already unlocked, you can just choose whatever carrier you want and buy a sim from them and use it on this phone and it will work without issues. Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying.

Pretty impressive!It's almost the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus and it's very slim, so it is not bulky if you want to put this in your pocket. Indeed a pocket-friendly phone.

It is an unlocked dual sim smart phone, so it is really perfect for us to use any GSM simcard that we want and we can use this phone as back up phone as well whenever we want to travel to another country.One of my favorite features of this phone is the voice search which is very similar to Siri app in iPhones. Very convenient feature! You don't have to type what you want to search just in case you feel lazy and tired. You just press the voice search, say what you want to search and voila! it will automatically give you the results of what you've been searching for.This phone has satisfied me in many ways.

       " 'I am so impressed with this T5 model unlocked phone from JUNING. Impressive, why? Getting an android phone for $77.99 is awesome, with all the great features that other expensive phone have and it works great with our wifi connections and also works great while using my GSM sim card. Works smoothly and fast because of the processor unit that is quad core which is the fastest CPU that can be found on expensive smartphones and has an android 5.1 that provides a performance and stability updates, multiple SIM card support, HD voice calling and \"Device Protection,\" which secures lost or stolen devices against factory resets. It has a dual unlocked sim, which is great for a person like me, I have a small business and my business phone number is always separated to my personal number, mostly I will not talk to customers on weekends so that I can spare time with my family. Another thing is, because it’s unlocked, it can be use or compatible to all gsm networks and works great while traveling to different places.Talking about the camera, I am surprisingly amazed even though it’s only has 2.0 MP both front and back but it’s really clear, it seems that it has a 5.0 MP same as my camera before with 5.0 MP. Watching a video and listening to music to it, are totally responsive without any hang ups experience, the audio is totally clear and loud. Last but not the least that I love the most, is the wide touch screen that I didn’t have before, the screen is wide and crisp with a decent resolution and most of all it is slim, thin and lightweight and a slick product, so fast to response with only a soft touch. It is really impressive and very affordable to everyone. I’ve been using this as my regular phone for a couple of days now and I really love the way it works and the appearance on this phone is very classy and so handy. As you can see on the images below the back cover has rough surface with a good grip to prevent you from dropping it. The package includes: T5 model phone, Battery, USB Cable, Power adapter and earphone. This phone has 4 color options to choose from, Black, gold, pink and white. Indeed, Impressive worth to keep and handle with care. Highly recommended to everyone who\\'s searching a affordable phone that works great. Thank you JUNING for this awesome product. I got this for free/discounted price through a promotional period and this is one of those deals where I am so blessed to get and test the efficiency and assess it for their future buyers. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well. I don’t get anything from it, but I get a good feeling that I helped someone. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.',\n",

       " 'This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review.

Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price.

I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.\",\n",

My old one was several years old and not working very well.I was very happy when I opened this phone and saw how big and clear the display is. This unlocked cell phone by Juning comes with the cell phone, battery, phone case, charger, USB cable and an earphone. It also has a thin screen protector on it.The phone itself is slim, lightweight and built well. It is 5.5 \" and has both front and back cameras. It is 3G which is fine as we mostly use wifi anyway. The camera is one of my favorite things about this phone. It takes awesome, clear, bright pictures!This cell phone stays charged for a long time even with lots of use. I love that it doesn\\'t have a ton of pre-installed, useless apps on it that you can\\'t uninstall. It also charges from the top instead of the bottom like most phones do which is great of you like to use your phone while it charges.This is a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.I received this unlocked cell phone by Juning for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This in no way affects how I feel about the product or my review of it.',\n",
       " 'I am sooo glad that I finally have a new phone! I always have a problem of my old phone because the screen stops working and i had my old phone I think more than 2 years now so ofcourse it already expected that I need a new one. And finally, when I got this Juning 5.5\" unlocked cell phones I never hesitate of purchasing this and would love to try this since this is my first time to have a unlocked phone. And when it arrived I was really impressed of how this phone looks so nice. The screen is so big and it is very slim and lightweight. It already has a screen protector and a phone casing. So I am not worried about how to find a phone casing because it is already included plus with a portable headset and a charger. So this is already has complete set. So I used my Verizon phone carrier and see if it does really works and I was totally impressed that it works. I got 3g of my phone which I can use it for wifi only. So far I like it. It works okay. As you can see in my video that I was provided you can see how does it works.And to my over all rating for this one so far this is nice for a reasonable price.I am so glad that I was given an opportunity to review this product for free in exchanged of my honest opinions.',\n",

Perform as describe so compared to more expensive BRAND name phones that do the same thing .This phone is the best for the price you cant beat it.This phone is good for travelers because work with all GSM sim card around the world. I travel to my home country quit often and to have an extra phone where I can just drop a sim card is a must. This phone has a nice 5.5 inch screen which is I love and its pretty slim and lightweight. It has a pretty bright high resolution screen and the touch screen is very responsive. Honestly I think this JUNNING X6 has better feature than my S5 the screen are bigger the camera is great its clear like me I love selfie it has a beauty built in, which you can edit your picture right away put makeup on ,blush, eye shadow, eye liner eye lash, lip color ,face foundation .For selfie lover like me this is the phone. Some of the apps like Facebook,playstore,weChat and WhatsApp are already downloaded on the phone.Its really cool and advance smartphone you could ever find it work same thing as the galaxy phone but 1/4 of a price.DISCLEAMER:I receive this product at discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is base on my honest opinion and has nothing to do with the price I paid for the product.',\n",
       " \"First thing you need to do on this phone is that set up a Google account to run your play store. It already have pre-installed Facebook, whatsapp, and gmail but you can install also other app that you love. The storage can hold up to 8GB enough space for you to save pictures, videos and games etc.Unfortunately this cellphone is only 3G but you can still use internet, on your phone by your SIM card or wifi works as good as 4G phones. I use sprint SIM card because it is the only phone company works at my area since l live out of town. But you can also use this phone with any other prepaid sim card.All in all this is a decent phone and it works good, affordable and user friendly. Though you can't compare this phone to a high end phone because you can still spot a difference. For the price this is a decent phone. I will recommend this phone.Disclaimer:This phone is provided for free to test and to review. My review is mine alone and it all honest and unbiased. It doesn't affect my review by receiving the product for free. Me myself I also rely on reviews before purchasing products, and I believe honest review is vital to other and to myself as well.

       " 'The JUNING phone I got was a 5.5\" Dual Sim Phone Unlocked 3G/GSM Android 5.1 Quad Core. Color : GOLDThe functionality of the phone is very similar to any Android phones but this one is very affordable and unlocked.The phone comes with:*Charger (USB-port)*Earphones*User\\'s Manual*Clear phone case*A piece of paper with the note in order to use the battery.(remove the yellow film)*Attached to the screen already,the screen protection/scratch protection (a thin sheet)Like any other phones you got to test the functionality of it and I find it very easy to navigate. It has the default apps that we commonly use, like Facebook, Wechat, Whatsapp, ect. I added Facebook Messenger, Youtube, Google chrome web browser and even added NETFLIX.Camera, which we mostly use to capture the moments and share it to our family and friends. I have no complain, it captures very clearly.Battery wise, I fully charged it the first time and I watched one full movie for like 2 hours and it has still a little half of the battery. I was able to explore some of the features, check emails and do some social networking.But you got to read the label or the note that comes with it because there is a little film that you need to remove in order for you to use the battery.Size and weight: I think it is the perfect size of the screen for me and not heavy at all to carry around. The GOLD color is a plus, it looks so sophisticated and sleek.If you wanna do some screenshots, just press the button volume down and power button together. Because it is 3G you do not expect it to be as fast and quick as 4G.I connected it to my Wi-Fi and and connects pretty well.Over all impression: For this price of an Unlocked android phone is pretty good. If you go overseas and you need a phone that is unlocked and you can just plug in a prepaid sim card, this is a perfect solution and highly recommend this. You don\\'t have to carry your phone that will charge you enormously when you use it overseas.I tried my T-Mobile sim and it works well.Got this phone in a discounted price for an honest review based on my experience while using it. And to help others who are looking for affordable and unlocked phones that works like any android phones that are expensive.',\n",

I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone.

       " 'This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review.

Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch.

       " 'This phone is pretty neat. For the price, it’s impressive – especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off – there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, I’m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:• Affordability• Functionality (Wifi + Data)• Can be used on most carriers• Huge screen• Front and back flash• Quad core processor• Comes with a screen protector and clear case• Large font optionsCons:• Lack of cases and accessories for the phone• Camera quality could be improved• Support for 4G would be nice• Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review.

The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth.

Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price.

I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion.\",\n",

It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage.

       " \"Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!!\",\n",

What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience.

You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me.

Wi-Fi connection was fine when at home or work when it had a network to connect to but not while using AT&T network (my carrier). Tried everything and got somewhat close. Sometimes it would work briefly. After loading for a few minutes a page might display but if you tried to click on a link or the next page it would say no network connection. So no internet on the go or GPS.Also if you were sent a link in a text from a friend or colleague the phone said it didn't have the correct program to continue and wouldn't connect. All in all the phone was just SO GLITCHEY! Every day something new would pop up. Even if the internet worked I just didn't feel safe having this phone as my source of contact to the world, like it would crash at any moment. My s3 just blew this phone away. Even if everything worked right it still didn't stack up. The big screen was nice but not as clear as my S3, and it was so freaking slow loading movies and pictures and web pages.I recommend avoiding this phone and looking into something else. Pay more and get something more reliable.\",\n",
       " \"I've had the phone for one month. It is already turning itself on and having trouble turning back on. The port to charge it is messed up and no charger will hardly stay connected. The camera is AWFUL. The pictures are terrible and the flash doesn't work. I have never been so upset in a phone purchase in all my life.\",\n",
       " \"As a previous review, there is a false advertising here! The Android OS in this phone is pretty much in Chinese language with no Google Play in it!!! It's understandable given the broad censorship happening there. To have an operational phone in English you'll have to flash the phone. If you are not technologically savvy you wouldn't buying this. It's really frustrating, even the manual comes just in Chinese language.\",\n",
       " 'Works very well',\n",

       " 'To keep it short Ill just say:This review is two parts - the 1st - this phone is amazing. Feels like 10K, looks like 10K, fast and clean. Benefits are there are MANY MANY roms to flash very easily. The phone feels like something you would want to own!The second - I RETURNED IT :-( . First is that you MUST check the ROM kernel. If it does not say \"ROW\" in the file name you will have a headache. Just that simple. But the most important is in does NOT run on the 850MHZ in 3G/HSPDA+. I repeat it is not a 850mhz Penta Band phone in upper bands. What does this mean for you? ATT, TMobile, and MVNOs (straight talk, ect) that run on these networks will ONLY GIVE YOU 2G speeds which are to be disbanded shortly. Very few places, mostly big cities, operate that 2100mhz in USA. So if you want it for USA - sad to say - we are gonna miss out on this one.I give it 4 stars for the fact that its a 10 star phone - but CANNOT be run in \"todays\" markets in the USA.Good luck all.NOTE: Purchased twice - 1st was AXOING = NO ROW, Chinese only!; 2nd - was APlusElek = Old Rom but WAS \"ROW\" so easy enough to work with for Google services. BUT NO USA',\n",
       " 'excellent product, great quality, nice price. And indeed this unlocked for use with any telephone company. Only you have to verify that the 3G band works in your country. Plus, is a lenovo technology',\n",
       " \"This is my second time buying a cellphone from amazon. As always, i did a heavy research BEFORE buying the phone and placing my order.My first impression of the phone was: Holy crap this is beautiful. Its thin, its slick and it is black and shiny all over the place! It is really something to admire.The first thing is: This phone is HUGE. Its totally a thing. And it wont stop being a thing. I mean it is a 5.5 inch screen, which makes this phone almost a tablet, which it is! so it is called a Phablet. The screen is very bright, crisp, and seriously, IPS? in my opinion the best choice for color and brightness,plus it saves battery. People complains that this phone doesn't have a 1080p screen, but really, if you can see the difference between the pixel density of this phone (aprox 200ppi ) and the pixel density of the iPhone (500 ppi) then your eyes must be better than the Kepler telescope. Go work at NASA or some stuff hehehehe. The screen size alone makes up for some things it is missing, and it totally should have, like a magnetometer. But don't get me wrong. This lil fella here is a powerhouse. It will make some phat rhymes and some ill beats for you if you play it rightThe feel of the phone is sturdy. It wont broke easily (nor i recommend you to try and break it. I mean come on) The back case has a good grip. Still i recommend you to get a phone cover, just in case. TPU will do or something more sturdier. I got one from http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY7SS72/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1It has a LCD screen cover plus the case!!Inside the box, i got the phone (Durrrrr), Charger, Battery, A screen cover !!, a 4 GB micro SD!! , USB Cable, Wall Adapter And some cool earphones. Really complete set in my opinion. It has the bare minimum to go strolling.The charger is of good quality, sturdy, as is the USB cable and the wall adapter.About the Battery. It is a 2250 mAh battery. Now in the last two weeks i only charged the phone once every 2 days. So that gives you an approximate of 2 days of battery with GPS , WIFI and DATA NETWORK on. But that's me, I don't play much with the phone, and my heavy using apps are social ones. There is an application on the phone called Lenovo Power that manages battery in a smart way so it lasts longer. I suggest to learn it and use it.OK, opening the back case is nothing short of easy. It has a little dent to the lower right side that allows you to pull the back case fast and easy.Inside you will find 2 standard sized SIM CARD slots, Micro SD slot up to 32 GB , Phone Camera, Audio Speakers And battery slot. The phone accepts mini SIM CARDS too. Now about the DUAL SIM you must know that the First one(The one on the left) Is able to Use 3G capabilities while the other one cannot. Don't Sweat it, this is standard practice. The second SIM CARD slot will be and shall be used for a second phone line used only for calls. The audio Speaker is of good Quality. And LOUD. Good lord that thing is noisy hehehe.This phone Id is LENOVO A850. Its not a lenovo A820 and it is totally NOT a SAMSUNG GALAXY 2,3 OR 4. Nevertheless it has a bunch of qualities that will prove quite useful.Why do i mention that you ask? It is because of the camera. I kid you not. Its a 5 MP camera. Its a really good camera, but some People might want this phone to shoot pictures at a quality that is beyond the hardware. The pictures are excellent in my opinion and they will work with whats-app and other apps. It has a lot of modes like continuous shooting and auto-focus and you can set up camera quality up to 5 MP. You can record video at high quality too. It seems 1080p But in fact it is scaled from a lesser resolution. Not a problem for me tho. As always, this is a phone, not a camera.This phone has a MT6582M mediatek CPU. It is a Quad-core@1.3 GHz with a GPU MALI-400MP2. What does this Means for you? Its Fast. Trust Me , really fast. Your multimedia will play with no problems and your games will go like silk. Games like NOVA 3 and Anomaly Korea . Cool.It has 4 GB of internal memory that translates in a total of 2.31 GB in real usable space. It has too 1 GB of ram. This will Make the phone faster too, because you will be multitasking a lot with this Phone .Now going to the front side of the phone, you will find in the top The brand of the phone (LENOVO) in shiny silver letters, your 3.5 Audio Plug, power Button ,speaker, frontal camera , proximity sensor and a notification led . The frontal camera is a 1.2 MP one, it wont transmit lots of data to Skype and other apps so its ideal to make video calls. The top speaker Works like a charm as well as the proximity sensor and the 4 colors notification LED (Blue,Red,Orange,Green). I guess the LED is fully Configurable But haven't tried it yet .I will Update As Possible.In the Bottom you will find 3 silver shiny soft touch buttons, micro USB slot and microphone.The soft Buttons are from left to right:Menu Button, Home Button and Go back Button. They are shiny and silver and they wont have BACK-LIGHT. They will be visible enough in the darkness so that's it.The right side of the phone has the +/- volume buttons. The left side has nothing.OK that's with the Physical stuff. Now we go to Software.First Thing First. This Phone posses a high grade of heavy customization. And as such, it is necessary that if you are going to make use it, you are able to at least, follow instructions precisely and know your way around android OS or a computer. Sorry but that's it if you want to customize it. If not, Then don't worry ! Most Sellers are very kind and they will get you (if you ask them of course) the phone in your language be it Spanish or English or whatevs and they will customize it for you. But seriously, ask them. Don{t expect them to do it just for giggles. And certainly, do not ask after getting the phone or placing the order. Before is OK.The software is a tricky thing. My phone came with a Android 4.2.2 Rom that is called S128 Xiaomijie. It was a Chinese ROM but it came in English. I just wiped it and installed another one called S121, made by Linerty. Its more stable for me. Ill post the links At the end for you all that want to customize the phone.There is a silver lining to this. There is an announce from mediatek that this phone will get android 4.4 KITKAT at the end of this month (18/04/2014 as today) so if you go trough with the ROM change you will get the experience needed to update to KITKAT later. All this will be done manually. Bollocks.Anyways, android 4.2 goes really fast in this phone. Man, so FAST. you will get lot of apps that will make your experience with this phone something worth sharing. Your live wallpapers will be smooth, your wireless will be fast and your calls will always go trough. The android integration is really cool and it will save you lots of trouble when you set up your APN's , because at the time you insert your sim card it will get all the info you need for it.The GPS is really exact. you will get accurate measures up to +/- 2 meters. You wont need a internet connection for it to work. Only when you download your maps but apart from that, no.This phone Works Excellently in Venezuela. It works with Movilnet and Movistar (SIM CARD 1) and with Digitel (SIM CARD 2) . That{s for GSM calls. For 3G and data connection its only the SIM CARD 1.Over all, this phone is a great Purchase. I give it 10/10 points because the sheer awesomeness . Have in mind that this is a mid-end phone.And it kicks some rump.About The Seller. It was LightInTheBox. They sent Directly from China Via DHL. It was a Fast shipment (For me). I communicated with themand they were always attentive and fast at answering. Id go with them again in any case.At The time i bought the Phone it was worth 169$ . I guess it will get cheaper so get it if you can :DOne thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S5/S4 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet. But it will prove reliable with office applications and such .Have a Nice Day !Thanks For Reading This.-18/04/2014-\",\n",

For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned',\n",
